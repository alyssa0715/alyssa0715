## Hello! â‹† Ëšï½¡â‹†à­¨à­§Ëš
My name is Alyssa Chavez and I am a Human Systems Engineering student with a focus in UX at Arizona State University âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ
After graduating I am looking forward to breaking into the UX Design field and contributing what I can there. I enjoy learning about coding, specifically in Java and HTML, but I would love to learn more!
